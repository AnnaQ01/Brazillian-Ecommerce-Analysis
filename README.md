The project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of Brazilian e-commerce performance over a specified time period, utilizing data visualization tools like Power BI. The analysis includes key metrics such as total sales, freight costs, customer satisfaction, and delivery performance across various product categories and geographic regions. With insights drawn from over 96,000 orders and 99,000 customers, the project aims to identify trends in purchasing behavior, shipping efficiency, and customer experience, providing valuable information for stakeholders to enhance operational strategies and improve overall service delivery.

**Strategic Suggestions**
- Optimize Shipping and Logistics:
  - Evaluate Carrier Performance: Analyze shipping times and costs across different carriers to identify the most efficient options. Consider renegotiating contracts for better rates or service levels.
  - Improve Delivery Times: Investigate the reasons behind late deliveries and implement strategies to streamline operations, such as better inventory management or local warehousing.
- Enhance Customer Experience:
  - Customer Feedback Loop: Use the average review score of 4.09 as a benchmark. Establish a system to collect and analyze customer feedback regularly to identify areas for improvement.
  - Loyalty Programs: Consider implementing loyalty programs or promotions to retain existing customers and encourage repeat purchases, especially in high-performing categories.
- Targeted Marketing Campaigns:
  - Geographic Focus: With SÃ£o Paulo being the top city for sales, develop targeted marketing campaigns in this region, leveraging local influencers and platforms for better engagement.
  - Product-Specific Promotions: Promote top-selling product categories through targeted advertising and seasonal promotions to capitalize on consumer trends.
